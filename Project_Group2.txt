Test information:

To test our application, you can log in as the following accounts:
 - test
 - bram
 - chloe
 - neha 

We have a lot of other user accounts, but they are mostly used to create sample data (sample recipes).

If you want to create a new account, just log in as a user account that does not currently exist. There is a toast when a new user is created. A list of all current users is displayed in the search section of the app under the 'users' tab.

To add a recipe:
 - Click on the (+) button on the home page

To message someone:
 - Go to the message tab and click the user want to message or start a new conversation (you must be mutually following the user to message them).
